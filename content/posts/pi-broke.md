So one of Resistor on the back on Pi broke and it stopped working.

Now with the RAM prices, even Pi is not cheap.  
I tried reattaching the resistor with adhesive but didn't work. But buying soldering equipment for only this doesn't feel worth it.  
I mostly used it as a server to learn ansible, ssh and even servers like nginx/caddy  on it.
